A fast, responsive and user-friendly Covid-19 Tracker built with React and Chart.js and styled with Material-UI, using Covid-19 Mathroid API. The site shows number of Infected, Recovered and Deaths on a global scale or by country via a count-up timer. The global scale is displayed on a line chart, while individual countries are displayed on bar charts.

Some of the benefits of using React and Material-UI together are that it guarantees better user experience and higher performance due to React features such as virtual DOM to which all the changes made are applied first and then, using the diff algorithm, the minimal scope of necessary operations is calculated and updated to the real DOM. The benefit of using Material Design is that Google has invested a lot of time and effort into UI and UX research, so customers can learn the apps faster, due to consistent navigation and behavior and previous familiarity.

-Better user experience 

-Higher performance and faster rendering

-Consistent design and behavior

-Faster and easier to develop

-Reusable components

-SEO friendly





This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
